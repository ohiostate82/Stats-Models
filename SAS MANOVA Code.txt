MANOVA IN SAS - CAREER GROUPS
proc glm data=talent;
class cargroup;
model english reading mechanic abstract math office = cargroup;
manova h = cargroup / printe printh summary;
run; quit;

p-value <0.01 reject the null hypothesis and that the mean scores for pairs are equivalent.
there are at least one set of responses for the groups that are different.

Each response variable is evaluated: math <0.01 - distinguishes among career groups
Office skills: <0.01 - distinguishes among career groups


USING SAS FOR TWO-SAMPLE CLASSIFICATION
Future Career Plans(1=business, 2=medicine, 3=teaching)
Gender(1=male, 2=female)
Scores on 6 tests:
   English
   Reading
   Mechanical Reasoning
   Abstract Reasoning
   Math
   Office Skills

We want to assess each of these 6 tests simutaneously.

SAS Code:
proc glm data=talent;
class cargroup gender;
model english reading mechanic abstract math office = cargroup | gender;
manova h /* hypothesis group */ = cargroup | gender / printe printh summary;
run; quit;

The Wilk's lambda is the test statistic is the inverse of most test statistics - smaller more significant
If we do not reject the null, we examine the interaction plots for behavior of the interaction
between the main effects.

assess the Error SSCP matrix - similar to SS for ANOVA
correlation matrix
test statistics: wilk's lambda 
p-value 0.03 - reject teh null and state there is an interaction between gender and career group
when there is not a significant impact on interaction effects we should look at the 
main effects individually.

math skills: cargroup 0.0009, gender 0.0026 cargroup*gender 0.0003
math skills has an interaction effect

you might take out reading and abstract (non-significant variables) and then
leave in Math and the other 2 and re-run the model.


Linear Discriminant Analysis: we want to classify observations into two or more
groups based on multiple response variables (machine learning)

MANOVA: we want to examine differences in means of multiple response variables 
across groups (hypothesis testing)

LDA - supervised classifcation

LDA creates a linear function that separates a data set into two more more populations
Example: swiss bank notes
genuine and counterfeit - 2 populations
six measures are taken on each note:
legnth
right hand and left hand
top and bottom
diagonal

we then take these measurements and model them to determine if the bank note
is counterfeit or genuine.

Assumptions:
common mean vector for each population
indepdently sampled subjects
multivariate normally distrubted data
variance-covariance matrices for each population are the same.
quadaratric variance-covariance matrices may be different. 

linear score function: computed for each population
prior probabilites are estimated from the training data.

SAS Code for LDA:
data insect;
infile '';
input species $ joint1 joint2 aedeagus;
run;

data test;
input joint1 joint2 aedeagus;
cards;
194 124 49
;

proc discrim data=insect pool=test /* determines linear vs quadratic */
crossvalidate testdata=test testout=a;
class species;
var joint1 joint2 aedeagus;
run;

proc print;

LDA will output linear coefficients to determine which species that the test 
statistic belongs to.

Bayesian Analysis:
regards the population to which a subject belongs as a parameter in the model.
Treats the identifcation of the population a subject belongs to as a random
variable.

Using Priors in SAS Code:

proc discrim data=insect pool=test crossvalidate testdata=test testout=a;
class species;
var joint1 join2 aedeagus;
priors "a"=0.9 "b"=0.1;
run;

a 0.05 b 0.94 = 94% probablity that species is in class B

Default for SAS is equal priors, but you can specify unequal priors which may
influence the probability results.
