Black-Karasinski Model
No arbitrage model - the forward price of a bond is the expected value
of the one-period-ahead spot bond price, under risk-neutral measure.

In this model, the Interest Rates are Lognormal and generated by two stochastic factors:
   1. Conditional mean of the short rate depends on the short rate
   2. Forward premium over the short rate

The conditional variance of the short rate is a function of time. It follows
that the model can be calibrated to the observed term structure of interest rate
volatilities implied by interest rate caps/floors. Essentially, the goal is to build a
term structure model which can be applied to value American-style contingent claims on
interest rates, which is consistent with the observed market prices of European-style
contingent claims. 

The principal purpose of building a term structure model is to price interest rate
options generally, and, in particular, those with path-dependent payoffs.
